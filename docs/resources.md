# Resources
The following is a list of resources that may come in handy for nostr designers and developers.

## Nostr Icons
The following icons were created by the community. Since Nostr doesn't have a logo that everyone can agree on, it is up to the app developer to decide which icon they wish to use. See the [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/vaWDSKYGlRu7yEmKlxtt6S/Nostr-Icons-%26-Buttons?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=tFHWCEed2S3S977r-1) for production-ready icons. You can also download the [zip file](/docs/resources/Nostr-Icons.zip) containing PNG and SVG versions of light and dark icons.
