It would be tempting to simply hide relays and never expose users to them, but this would be a mistake. Users need to understand the concept of relays in order to understand how Nostr works. The same goes for keys, which are essential to how nostr operates. Simply renaming them to username and password would be abstracting away too far. Instead, provide useful hints to explain what keys are and how they work.
